# Certainly! This approach involves leveraging AWS Route 53's health checks and failover routing policy to switch between your primary resource (ALB) and a secondary resource (CloudFront distribution serving a maintenance page) based on the health of your primary resource.

# Here's a breakdown:

# 1. **Setup the CloudFront Distribution for Maintenance Page:**
#    - As you've shared in your previous question, you already have a CloudFront distribution serving content from an S3 bucket, which has your maintenance page.

# 2. **Create a Route 53 Health Check for ALB:**
#    Route 53 health checks will monitor the health of your ALB. If the health check fails, Route 53 can route traffic to your secondary (maintenance) resource.
   
#    ```hcl
#    resource "aws_route53_health_check" "alb_health_check" {
#      fqdn              = aws_lb.main.dns_name
#      port              = 443
#      type              = "HTTPS"
#      resource_path     = "/" # Or your health check endpoint
#      failure_threshold = "3"
#      request_interval  = "30"
#    }
#    ```

# 3. **Configure Route 53 Records with Failover Routing Policy:**
#    - **Primary Record**: This points to your ALB. 
# It's associated with the health check. If the health check fails, 
# Route 53 will not route traffic to this record.
   
#    - **Secondary Record**: This points to your CloudFront distribution. 
# It serves traffic only when the primary resource is unhealthy.

# Secondary record pointing to CloudFront distribution

# When you have all this set up:

# - As long as the ALB is healthy, all traffic will go to your application served by the ALB.
# - If the ALB becomes unhealthy (as determined by the Route 53 health check),
# traffic will be automatically directed to the CloudFront distribution serving the maintenance page.

# This approach allows you to automate failover to a maintenance page when your primary application is down.
